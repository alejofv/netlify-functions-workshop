    Jekyll and Netlify functions</p>
    
<p class="my-4 text-gray-300">
    This is a simple static website generated with Jekyll and deployed to Netlify, which uses a serverless
    function to fetch dynamic content from an external API.
</p>
<p class="my-4 text-gray-300">
    It's intended to show basic concepts around the JAMStack on Netlify, such as Static Site Generators,
    git-based deployment and Netlify functions as APIs.
